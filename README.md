ðŸ”— [Interactive dashboard can be accessed here](https://www.novypro.com/project/road-accident-analysis-74)

This project presents an analysis of raw data from Data Tutorials (YouTube) aimed at providing insights into road accidents in 2021 and 2022 to support efforts in improving road safety. MS SQL Server was employed for data validation and Power BI was employed to:

- Clean and process the data (307,975 rows, 21 columns)
- Develop a star schema data model
- Create interactive visualisations addressing client requirements:
  * Total casualties & accidents (Year-on-Year comparisons)
  * Casualties by severity & vehicle type
  * Monthly trends (current vs. previous year)
  * Casualties by road type, area/location, and day/night
  * Total casualties & accidents by location
- Implement custom DAX measures (details documented separately)

Technical Skills:

- Data cleaning
- Data pre-processing
- Data modelling
- Power BI dashboard creation & visualisation design
- Advanced DAX measures development
